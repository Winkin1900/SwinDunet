## Simulated Dataset
We obtain the datasets of historical vector contours and latest images close to the actual situation by our proposed simulation method based on two commonly used public building semantic segmentation datasets (WHU Building Dataset and Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset). The code for our simulation method is available (code below) or you can get the dataset we simulated through the link(below):
